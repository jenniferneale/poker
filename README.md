In order to get a good handle on this problem, I broke the objects that were given into different files and wrote some tests. I corrected a few typos and made comments and changes throughout. I haven't played much poker, but the problem of evaluating card combinations based on particular patterns is an interesting one. Given more time, I would have liked to continue with additions and restructuring and make something playable, maybe as a fun text adventure game instead of a traditional graphical interface, so it would be easier to implement a system of players and their tells. (Eg, "The Duchess sniffs disapprovingly at her cards.")
